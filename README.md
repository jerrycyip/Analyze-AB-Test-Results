# Analyze-AB-Test-Results
Analyzing the results of an A/B test run by a fictitious e-commerce website to determine whether a new page increases user engagement (specifically successful user conversions) or not.  Analysis is done in Python and Jupyter notebooks and leverages popular Python data analytics and data science packages: pandas, numpy, statsmodels, matplotlib, random. To arrive at our conclusions we employ different statistical methods including 1) hypothesis testing to compare whether the p-value of our null hypothesis - that the original 'control' page is equally or more effective at generating user conversions than the new 'treatment' page - is less than our desired Type I (aka alpha) error rate of 5% as well as 2) fitting a logistical regression model to see if there is a significant difference in conversion based on which page a customer receives.
